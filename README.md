# CNN-Fashion-dataset
This repository contains the code for my Kaggle competition entry, in which I placed 12th. The competition dataset was a set of images that had been misclassified. The goal of the competition was to create a CNN classifier that has good accuracy and predictions on the misclassified data.

I hope this code is useful to others who are interested in improving the accuracy of CNN classifiers on misclassified images.
